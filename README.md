# DOS-attack-on-my-own-webserver
I want to observe a DOS attack, so I decided to make a simple webserver and attack it.

I've seen people in the internet doing this with two virtual machines on one machine, but I decided against it. Besides of the fact this person did not succeed, and I actually have a spare device to perform this, I thought it would make more sense to use two different devices, since in real life, attackers usually use a device/ devices appart from the server.
